## Introduction
* You may have encountered Big O notation when we are discussing about algorithm. 

* For example in sorting algorithms, _merge sort_ is said to be `O(n log n)`, while _insertion sort_ is said to be `O(n^2)`. 

* Here are basic questions that we are going to discuss;
 * What does this notation mean?
 * How do we derive such term? 
 * Based on the term, how do we know which algorithm is better than the other?
